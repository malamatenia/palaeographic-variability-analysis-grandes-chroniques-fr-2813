### Abstract 
This study introduces an interpretable scribal hand characterization and variability analysis based on a deep learning framework combining graphic tools with statistical analysis of scribal practices. Designed to bridge the gap between traditional palaeographic methods â€” based on qualitative observations â€” and automatic computational models, our approach enables interpretable character-level inter- and intra-scribal variation analysis and graphic profiling. We demonstrate our method to Charles Vâ€™s copy of the Grandes Chroniques de France (Paris, BnF, fr. 2813), revisiting the traditional attribution to two royal scribes of Charlesâ€™ V, Henri de TrÃ©vou and Raoulet dâ€™OrlÃ©ans. Through the definition of graphic profiles and complementary statistical analysis of abbreviation usage and space management, we offer a more systematic and context-aware understanding of scribal behaviour. Beyond this case study, the approach opens new possibilities for palaeographic inquiry, from mapping script evolution to characterizing scribal variability in a communicable and interpretable way.

### Repository Structure

- In the ```data``` folder, the data is available in two forms, ground truth (images + XML ALTO files) and the processed dataset for our experiment. Data are available also on Zenodo: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.15282371](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15282371)

### Prototype Generation: 
Character prototypes are generated using the [Learnable Typewriter](https://learnable-typewriter.github.io/) approach. The Learnable Typewriter is a deep instance segmentation model designed to reconstruct text lines by learning the dictionary of visual patterns that make it up. Given an input image of a text line, the modelâ€™s task is to reconstruct the input image, by compositing the learned character prototypes onto a simple background. Each prototype is a grayscale image can be thought of as the optimized average shape of all occurrences of a character in the training data, standardized for size, position, and color. Training the model on a specific corpus â€” such as manuscripts in a particular script type or a particular hand â€” produces a set of ideal letterforms of the given corpus, resembling the abstracted alphabets used for palaeographical analysis. It has been adapted to handle medieval handwriting and prototype comparison in the [Learnable Handwriter](https://learnable-handwriter.github.io/) version. If you want to learn more about the prototype generation and train the Learnable Handwriter on your data, please refer to the project github: https://github.com/malamatenia/learnable-handwriter.
