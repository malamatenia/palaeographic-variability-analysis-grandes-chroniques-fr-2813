### Abstract 
This study introduces an interpretable scribal hand characterization and variability analysis based on a deep learning framework combining graphic tools with statistical analysis of scribal practices. Designed to bridge the gap between traditional palaeographic methods — based on qualitative observations — and automatic computational models, our approach enables interpretable character-level inter- and intra-scribal variation analysis and graphic profiling. We demonstrate our method to Charles V’s copy of the Grandes Chroniques de France (Paris, BnF, fr. 2813), revisiting the traditional attribution to two royal scribes of Charles’ V, Henri de Trévou and Raoulet d’Orléans. Through the definition of graphic profiles and complementary statistical analysis of abbreviation usage and space management, we offer a more systematic and context-aware understanding of scribal behaviour. Beyond this case study, the approach opens new possibilities for palaeographic inquiry, from mapping script evolution to characterizing scribal variability in a communicable and interpretable way.

### Repository Structure

- In the ```data``` folder, the data is available in two forms, ground truth (images + XML ALTO files) and the processed dataset for our experiment. Data are available also on Zenodo: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.15282371](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15282371)

```

│   └── processed_dataset/      # Dataset curated for our analysis using the Learnable Handwriter
```

- In the ```scripts``` folder, we include the notebooks and utils for the analysis

### Prototype Generation: 
Character prototypes are generated using the [Learnable Typewriter](https://learnable-typewriter.github.io/) approach. The Learnable Typewriter is a deep instance segmentation model designed to reconstruct text lines by learning the dictionary of visual patterns that make it up. Given an input image of a text line, the model’s task is to reconstruct the input image, by compositing the learned character prototypes onto a simple background. Each prototype is a grayscale image can be thought of as the optimized average shape of all occurrences of a character in the training data, standardized for size, position, and color. Training the model on a specific corpus — such as manuscripts in a particular script type or a particular hand — produces a set of ideal letterforms of the given corpus, resembling the abstracted alphabets used for palaeographical analysis. It has been adapted to handle medieval handwriting and prototype comparison in the [Learnable Handwriter](https://learnable-handwriter.github.io/) version. If you want to learn more about the prototype generation and train the Learnable Handwriter on your data, please **[refer to the tutorial page](https://learnable-handwriter.github.io/tutorial.html)**.
